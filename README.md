# Cost Calculator Per Person For Cow Share (Eid ul Adha)
This repository contains code for calculating cost of cow share per person based on different inputs. 
There are seven shares per cow. It is very time consuming to calculate and record expenses of individual cows and persons. 
I created an app where user can input different types of cost and based on that it will calculate total cost per animal and other costs. 
It will also create a table where each users receieved and refundable amounts can be automatically calculated.
